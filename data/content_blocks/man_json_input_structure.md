Each JSON represents one document:

metadata (doc_id, title, version, document_type, dates, owner)

sections (strings, {"use_block": "…"}, or lists)

front-matter tables (classification, handling, retention, approvals, distribution)

dynamic_tables with: target.after_heading, create_if_missing, optional bold heading, table_style: "TracWater table", columns, rows. Include “Related Documents” and other references as needed.
